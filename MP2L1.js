      Option: a contract which gives the buyer (the owner or holder) the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset or instrument at a specified strike price on or before a specific date. Risk avoidance: elimination of hazards and exposures that can negatively affect an organization’s assets. Withdraw or not involved.
      Risk reduction: optimize or mitigate losses, such as outsourcing
      Risk sharing/transfer: transfer risks to others contractually or through insurance. Or share the burden of loss with other parties
      Risk acceptance: retain the risk as the cost of insuring against the risk is greater than the losses sustained. Any amount of potential loss over the amount insured is retained risk.

A call option is an option to buy a stock. The seller of the call option is giving the buyer of the option the right to buy the stock at a specific price, called the exercise price or strike price, before a certain date. If the buyer of the option decides to exercise the option, the seller (also called the writer) of the option is obligated to sell the stock to the buyer of the option at the exercise price.
    A naked call option is an option to buy a stock that the seller of the option does not own. If the option is exercised by the buyer of the option, the seller of the option must purchase the stock on the market at the market price in order to have the stock to sell to the buyer of the option at the exercise price. If the option is exercised, the market price will be higher than the exercise price. If it were not, the call option would not have been exercised. Since there is no limit to how high a stock's market price can go, there is no limit to the amount that the seller of the naked call option would have to pay to purchase the stock and thus no limit to the potential loss to the seller of the naked call option.

Therefore, enterprise risk management should be integrated with strategy selection, not treated as an add-on activity after the strategy has been chosen.</div>'

    ansExplain: `<div class="ExplnAns">Correct answer: D The expected maximum probable loss (also called the probable maximum loss, or PML) is the largest loss that can occur under foreseeable circumstances. This is the largest amount of damage that is likely to occur in a very bad year.
    The expected maximum probable loss is inversely related to the size of the building. When we say that something is inversely related to something else, it means that the two things move in opposite directions. When one thing increases, the other thing decreases, and when one thing decreases, the other thing increases. The larger a commercial building is, the less probability there is that the largest loss that can occur under foreseeable circumstances will occur. So as the size of the building increases, the expected maximum probable loss decreases.
    Even though the amount of the maximum possible loss may be greater for a large building than it is for a smaller building, the probability of that amount of loss occurring is much smaller for a large building than it is for a small building. When the probability of the maximum loss occurring is multiplied by the amount of the maximum possible loss, the expected maximum probable loss will generally be smaller for a large building than for a small building.

    ansExplain: `<div class="ExplnAns">Correct answer: C Risk assessment is the process of analyzing and considering risks from two perspectives: (1) the likelihood of the risk's occurring and (2) the potential impact of the event if it does occur.
    The likelihood of the risk's occurring is called the loss frequency. The potential impact of the event if it does occur is called loss severity.
    Loss frequency is the measurement of how often the loss occurs, on average. Loss frequency is expressed in relation to a time period such as a year. A loss frequency of
    0.25 per year means there is a 25% probability that a loss will take place in any given year, and on average, a loss occurs once every four years.
    Loss severity measures how serious a loss is when it occurs, in terms of cost. For example, historically when a loss has occurred, the average cost of the loss is $50,000.
    Both the loss frequency and the loss severity are used in measuring the potential loss that could occur from a specific risk and thus assessing the risk.

    •	Event identification. Events are the internal and external events that affect the organization’s implementation of its ERM strategy or the achievement of its objectives.
    •	Risk assessment.

    •	Risk response. Risk response is what the company decides to do with respect to each of the risks identified. Management must develop a response for each of its identified risks.
    •	Control activities. Control activities are the policies and procedures implemented to ensure the risk responses are carried out.
    •	Information and communication. This includes all the relevant information that needs to be communicated to the appropriate people, within a time frame that will allow them to carry out their duties.
    •	Monitoring. The system put in place needs to be monitored to ensure it continues to be appropriate and continues to be properly operated.
