    q: "A multinational company maintains its financial records under both IFRS and U.S. GAAP. Last year, the company determined its inventory was impaired because demand for its product collapsed when a competitor launched a new product with innovative features. As a result, the company wrote down its inventory to $0 with a carrying amount of $500,000. This year, however, government authorities unexpectedly announced that the competitor’s product was defective and the product was removed from the market. As a result, the company’s products were again in demand and the company estimated their net realizable value to be $750,000 at the end of the current quarter. How should the company record this new development in the current quarter?",
